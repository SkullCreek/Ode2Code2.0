<h3>ODE2CODE2.0</h3>
<hr>
<h2>The Challenge</h2>
To create a billing app integrated across all devices (mobiles and PCs) and outlets to be used by the vendor/operator at the Point of Sale (POS) 
<h2>Ideation üë©‚Äçüíª</h2>
My idea is to build a web billing application which can be divided into 3 main categories that are Payment, product, Vendor which will ease customer buy (Note: The features uder 3 major categories are explained properly in ‚ÄúFeatures that are good to have‚Äù part). We can trigger and add features in these areas. In the payment part we can give them point redeems/discount coupons based on their purchase, So that customer is satisfied. Second is product Part in which we can build a recommandation system through which the vendor can recommand the customer based on their selection and we can store the data and can make many more features out of it. In the vendor part we can make easy for the vendor to manage there purches by daily, monthly, yearly report and sales graph. Some additional featues that we be added are Product List, Return product and Authentication.
